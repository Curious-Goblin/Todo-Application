# Todo Application

This Todo Application is a simple project built with HTML and JavaScript. It showcases basic state management and DOM manipulation, similar to React's reconciliation process.

2. Enter a todo name and description in the input fields provided.
3. Click on the "Add Todo" button to add the todo to the list.
4. Once a todo is completed, click on the corresponding checkbox to mark it as done.
5. Observe the real-time updates in the UI as todos are added and marked as done.
